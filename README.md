A project to help Rockbuster develop a strategy to compete against other companies 
Rockbusters is a movie rental company on a mission to rival established streaming services. I'm tasked with managing their extensive dataset within a relational database system, employing SQL to delve deep into the data, extracting insights to address questions posed by stakeholders.
